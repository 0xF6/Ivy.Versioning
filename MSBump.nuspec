        <description>
          I'm working on a lot of packages that are referencing each other, but they are in different solutions.
          To make my project references maintainable, I use a local NuGet feed, and reference my projects as NuGet packages.
          However, in this setup, I'd have to manually change the version every time I change something in a package
          that is referenced by other solutions, to make NuGet pull the updates. This task will increment any given
          part of the project version.
